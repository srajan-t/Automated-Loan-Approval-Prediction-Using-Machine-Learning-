# Automated-Loan-Approval-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-
 project builds a machine learning model to automate loan approval decisions based on applicant details like income, education, credit history, and employment status. It uses a Random Forest Classifier and includes end-to-end steps from data cleaning and visualization to model training, evaluation, and deployment using joblib.
Key Features:

Data preprocessing and feature encoding

Missing value handling

Correlation heatmap and EDA

Random Forest model training and evaluation

Model serialization for reuse


ðŸ“¦ Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Joblib
